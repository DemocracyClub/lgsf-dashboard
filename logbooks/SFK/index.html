        <dd>An error occurred (ParentCommitIdOutdatedException) when calling the CreateCommit operation: The parent commit ID is not valid because it is not the current tip of the branch. You must provide the commit ID for the tip of the branch. The most common reason for this error is that your local repository is not synchronized to the latest changes in the AWS CodeCommit repository. Either synchronize your local repo by using the git pull command, or use GetBranch to retrieve the latest commit ID for the branch, and then try again.</dd>

           when calling the CreateCommit operation: The parent                  
           commit ID is not valid because it is not the current                 
           tip of the branch. You must provide the commit ID for                
           the tip of the branch. The most common reason for this               
           error is that your local repository is not

           repo by using the git pull command, or use GetBranch                 
           to retrieve the latest commit ID for the branch, and                 
           then try again.
